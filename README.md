# 🐍 Python Practice Basics

This repository contains my Python practice programs, starting from basic concepts and gradually moving to more advanced topics.  
I’m adding new programs regularly as I learn and improve my problem-solving skills.

- basics – fundamental Python concepts like variables, input, data types, and operators  
- control_flow – if-else statements and loops  
- data_structures – lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples  
- functions – function-based programs and modular coding  
- oops – object-oriented programming concepts  
- logic – logical and interview-style problems  

## Current Progress
- Basics – started and ongoing  
- Control Flow – in progress  
- Data Structures – planned  
- Functions – planned  
- OOP – planned  
- Logic Problems – planned  

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to strengthen my Python fundamentals and prepare for backend development and technical interviews.
